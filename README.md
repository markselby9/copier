It's a practice project for React.js, node.js and others. 

##What's this

I'm trying to make a simple copy & paste tool between different devices, so that people can easily:

1. copy a sentence into here
+ submit it and get a short code
+ then get the sentence on other device or by another person.

##Usage

Temporarily, use "nodemon" to run the server scripts. 

+ Please make sure you have mongodb installed and running, then run "npm start" to run the server program.
+ Then use any browser to open "client/index.html" to use copier.
